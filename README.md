# José Ángel de Bustos Pérez

I have a long career in the IT industry with more than 20 years of experience, during which I have held various roles such as consultant, project manager, pre-sales engineer, as well as speaker and presenter at technology events. I am a strong advocate of Free and Open Source software and I was actively involved for several years in local Linux User Groups (LUGs) in Spain, organizing events to promote Free and Open Source Software.

Regarding my academic background, although I originally earned a degree in Mathematics from the University of Salamanca, focusing my studies on numerical analysis, I have continued to read and educate myself independently, mainly in the field of artificial intelligence. Nearly 20 years after completing my degree, I obtained a master's degree in artificial intelligence. Just a year later, I decided to embark on a new and exciting journey by pursuing a master's in quantum computing. I have also collaborated as a lecturer in specialized programs at the [University of Salamanca](https://www.usal.es/) and the [International University of La Rioja](https://www.unir.net/).

I enjoy learning and taking on new challenges, but I also believe in the importance of disconnecting. To do so, I like to spend time with family and friends, engaging in various hobbies. Some of my favorite activities include listening to music, walking in nature, cycling, playing golf, airsoft, practicing precision shooting at a shooting range, as well as going on motorcycle and off-road adventures to find landscapes and wildlife to photograph.
